## Description

Managing pending LinkedIn invitations one by one can be time-consuming. This script simplifies the process by automating the withdrawal of sent connection invitations in bulk. It scrolls through the "Sent Invitations" page on LinkedIn, identifies "Withdraw" buttons for each pending invitation, and clicks to confirm the action.

## Features

- Loads pending invitations automatically by scrolling through the page.
- Identifies and clicks "Withdraw" buttons for each pending invitation.
- Confirms each withdrawal through LinkedIn's confirmation popup.
- Logs the number of invitations withdrawn for tracking.

## Requirements

- **Browser**: Use a browser with Developer Tools (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
- **LinkedIn Account**: Make sure you‚Äôre logged in to LinkedIn before running the script.

## Setup and Usage

### Step 1: Open LinkedIn Invitations Page

1. Log into your LinkedIn account.
2. Go to the [Sent Invitations](https://www.linkedin.com/mynetwork/invitation-manager/sent/) page.

### Step 2: Open Developer Console

1. Press `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + J` (on Windows) or `Cmd + Option + J` (on Mac) to open the Developer Console in your browser.

### Step 3: Copy and Run the Script

1. Copy the code below and paste it into the Developer Console:

    ```javascript (async function bulkWithdrawLinkedInInvitations() {
    console.log("üöÄ Starting bulk withdrawal of LinkedIn invitations...");

    const delay = (ms) => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));

    // Scroll to load all invitations
    for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
        window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);
        await delay(1500);
    }

    // Get all 'Withdraw' buttons
    const withdrawButtons = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll("button"))
        .filter(btn => btn.innerText.trim() === "Withdraw");

    console.log(`üìå Found ${withdrawButtons.length} invitations to withdraw.`);

    let withdrawnCount = 0;

    for (const button of withdrawButtons) {
        try {
            button.scrollIntoView({ behavior: "smooth", block: "center" });
            await delay(800);
            button.click();
            await delay(1000);

            // Wait up to 5 seconds for the dialog's confirm button to appear
            let confirmBtn = null;
            for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                confirmBtn = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll("button"))
                    .find(b => b.innerText.trim() === "Withdraw" && b.getAttribute("aria-label")?.includes("invitation sent"));

                if (confirmBtn) break;
                await delay(500);
            }

            if (confirmBtn) {
                confirmBtn.click();
                withdrawnCount++;
                console.log(`‚úÖ Withdrawn (${withdrawnCount}): Success`);
                await delay(2000); // delay before next
            } else {
                console.warn("‚ùå Confirm Withdraw button not found.");
            }
        } catch (err) {
            console.error("‚ùå Error withdrawing invitation:", err);
        }
    }

    console.log(`üéâ Total invitations withdrawn: ${withdrawnCount}`);
})();```

2. Press `Enter` to execute the script.
3. The script will scroll through the page, identify, and withdraw each pending invitation. Each withdrawal is logged in the console.

## Limitations

- **LinkedIn Rate Limits**: LinkedIn may limit actions temporarily if too many invitations are withdrawn in a short period. If this occurs, wait a few minutes and run the script again.
- **Manual Execution**: This script requires you to open the Developer Console and paste it each time you wish to run it. 

## Troubleshooting

- **Buttons Not Found**: If the script is unable to find "Withdraw" buttons, LinkedIn may have updated its page layout. Check for updates to the script in this repository or adjust the selectors in the script to match LinkedIn‚Äôs new layout.
- **Rate Limits**: If you receive an error or notice withdrawals are temporarily restricted, allow some time before running the script again.

## Disclaimer

This script is for educational purposes and personal use only. Excessive use of automated actions may violate LinkedIn's terms of service. Please use responsibly to avoid action limitations or account suspension.
